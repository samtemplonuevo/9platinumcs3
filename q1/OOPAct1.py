## DESIGN EXPLANATION
### Why did you choose this class?
Because films have been my favorite form of media for the past few years and I'd like to create something that I think is meaningful to me and what I'd like to work on for.

### Which property is the most important and why?
Play is definitely the most important property because in order to watch a movie, you need to be able to play it. Play also allows you to interact with the movie and experience it.

### Which method is the most useful and why?
For me, I love it when other people rate the movies I want to watch cause it gives me a better point of view on whetherr or not I should watch it. So setRating is the most useful method for decisions like that.
